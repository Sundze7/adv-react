REACT HOOKS

Generally hooks,
> start with 'use' (both react and custom hooks)
> component must be uppercase
> invoked inside function/component body
> are not called conditionally (e.g inside if blocks)
> set functions don't update state immediately

USESTATE

> returns an array with 2 elements: the current state value, and a function that we can use to update the state
> useState() preserves the values between the renders
> state update triggers re-render

if you want to update the state immediately and synchronously, u can pass a fxn to setState that receives the previous state as an argument and returns the new state e.g 

setState((prevState) => {
    return {...prevState, value: newValue}
})

USEEFFECT

> Allows u to perform side effects in fxn components e.g subscription, fetching data, direct DOM update, event listeners, timers, etc.
> it accepts 2 args: a cb fxn and a dependency array (optional)
> Runs on each render (initial and re-render)
> cb fxn cannot return a promise (so can't make it async)
if dependency array empty [], it runs only on initial render.
> in a case where u have multiple conditionals, place useEffect above them ans not below.

> setInterval() returns an index by default

USEREF()

- Does not trigger re-render
- Preserves the value between renders
- targets DOM nodes/elements
