REACT HOOKS

Generally hooks,
> start with 'use' (both react and custom hooks)
> component must be uppercase
> invoked inside function/component body
> are not called conditionally (e.g inside if blocks)
> set functions don't update state immediately

USESTATE
> returns an array with 2 elements: the current state value, and a function that we can use to update the state
> useState() preserves the values between the renders
> state update triggers re-render

if you want to update the state immediately and synchronously, u can pass a fxn to setState that receives the previous state as an argument and returns the new state e.g 

setState((prevState) => {
    return {...prevState, value: newValue}
})
